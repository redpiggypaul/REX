    <string name="terms_condition_content11">Talent Exchange and all information provided to you hereunder are provided "as is", "as available", and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, PwC and its respective officers, directors, partners, principals, personnel, affiliates, business associates, licensors, third party providers of services and subcontractors (collectively and inclusive of PwC, the "PwC Parties") disclaim all warranties with respect to the same, express, implied and statutory, including without limitations any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, completeness, non-infringement, non-interference, error-free service and uninterrupted service. This agreement is not an offer of any financial, tax, accounting, legal or other professional services or goods.</string>
    <string name="terms_condition_content12">To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the PwC Parties shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation damages for lost profits or revenues, goodwill, work stoppage, security breaches, viruses, computer failure or malfunction, use, data or other intangible losses or commercial damages, even if any such parties are advised of the possibility of such losses, arising under or in connection with this agreement, Talent Exchange, the use or inability to use the same, or any other subject matter hereof. In addition, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the PwC Parties shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by you which arises out of or in connection with any information or materials obtained or submitted by you via or in connection with Talent Exchange. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will the aggregate liability of the PwC Parties under this agreement or in connection with its subject matter exceed five thousand U.S. Dollars ($5,000). Other PwC firms and their respective partners, principals, and employees, licensors and third party provider of services and subcontractors (collectively, the \"beneficiaries\") have no liability or obligations arising out of the agreement. You agree to bring any claim arising from the use of Talent Exchange against PwC and not against the beneficiaries. While PwC is entering into the agreement on its own behalf, this section is for the benefit of the beneficiaries and is relied on by each beneficiary. PwC accepts the benefits on their behalf.</string>
    <string name="terms_condition_content13">To the extent Talent Exchange contains links to other websites and outside services and resources, we do not control the availability and content of those websites, services or resources, nor do we necessarily review or endorse materials available at or through such other websites.

    <string name="terms_condition_content14">Either you or PwC may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause, at any time. All terms and conditions of this Agreement that are intended by their nature to survive termination of this Agreement shall survive termination and remain in full force, including but not limited to the terms and conditions concerning any disclaimers, intellectual property rights, duties of confidentiality, limitations of liability, duties of indemnification and provisions regarding resolution of differences. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, you must cease all use of Talent Exchange.</string>
    <string name="terms_condition_content15">This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable U.S. federal law and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United States Federal and New York State courts located in and serving the City of New York in connection with any dispute or claim arising under this Agreement. Each party waives any right that it may have to assert that such forum is not convenient. Each party agrees not to demand a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to Talent Exchange. The 1980 UN Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement.\n\nIn the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any procedures or requirements set out in Talent Exchange, the provisions of this Agreement will prevail. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void or illegal, it will be severed from this Agreement and will not affect, impair or invalidate any other provision, and it will be replaced by a provision which comes closest to such severed provision in language and intent without being invalid, void or illegal.\n\nPwC may amend this Agreement at any time by providing a copy of the amended terms and conditions to you in any format, including electronically via Talent Exchange, which you must then accept or reject. If you reject such amended terms and conditions, this Agreement shall terminate automatically. This Agreement may not be otherwise amended. You may not assign, transfer, or change any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of PwC. PwC may assign this Agreement in whole or in part without your consent.\n\nNo right under this Agreement or breach hereof may be waived except in writing signed by the parties hereto. The failure of either party to require performance of any provision of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of such party\'s rights to insist on performance of such provision or any other hprovision at some other time.</string>
